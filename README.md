# The official rulebook of Förbundskansler

## Start of the game
- One player is selected as "förbundskansler" and stand alone on their side of the table.
- The other players stand on the opposite side of the table.
- When there are more than 5 players, the game is played in "sudden" mode after
  the first player has been kicked (to avoid excessive waiting times)

## During the game
- The "förbundskansler" always serves the ball.
- The opposing players strikes one ball each.
- If the opposing players misses the ball they get a penalty point.
- After 2 penalty points you're out.
- If the "förbundskansler" misses a ball, the winner becomes the new "förbundskansler".
- When someone becomes "förbundskansler" their penalty points are removed.

## Sudden
- Short for sudden death.
- If there has been 3 exchanges of the "förbundskansler" position, without any penalty points dealt, the game enters "sudden".
- In "sudden" any opposing player that looses a ball is immediately eliminated from the game, and the game goes back to normal.
- When a "förbundskansler" looses the ball in "sudden" the game enters "super sudden". This is the same as "sudden".

## Perfect rounds
A perfect round can be achieved by the “förbundskansler” if the following requirements are met:
- The “förbundskansler” wins one round against a minimum of four players.
- The “förbundskansler” reaches the final of the next round without losing the status of “förbundskansler”
- The “förbundskansler” wins that final of that round without losing a point to the opposing player.

The "förbundskansler" has to, at some point during the round, announce that he/she is heading for a perfect round.

The opposing players are then compelled by *International Förbundskansler Federation ™* honor standards to buy the victorious “förbundskansler” lunch (“Dagens A”, for example).
